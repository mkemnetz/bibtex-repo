  title={Feed-forward adaptive-optic correction of a weakly-compressible high-subsonic shear layer},
  journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
  pages={311},
  abstract={Development of airborne laser systems began in the 1970s with the Airborne Laser Laboratory, a KC135 aircraft with a CO2 laser projected from a beam director mounted atop the aircraft as a hemispherical turret encased in a fairing. It was known that the turbulent air flowing around the turret and separating over the aft portions of the turret would aberrate the laser beam's wavefront (the aero-optic problem); however, the CO2 wavelength, 10.6 μm, was long enough that the aberrating turbulent flow decreased the system's performance by only about 5\%. With newer airborne laser systems using wavelengths nearer 1 μm, this same turbulent flow now reduces system performance by more than 95\%. It has long been known that if a conjugate waveform is used to pre-distort the outgoing laser's wavefront, the turbulence will actually correct the beam, restoring most of the system's performance. The problem with performing this compensation is that the system for performing this function, the so-called adaptive-optic system, is bandwidth limited in its conventional architecture, by orders of magnitude lower than that required to correct for the aero-optic effects. The research described in this dissertation explored changing the adaptive-optic paradigm from feedback to feed-forward by adding flow control to make the aberration environment predictable rather than unpredictable. This research demonstrated that the turbulent high-speed separated shear layer could be robustly forced into a regularized form. It was also shown that these regularized velocity patterns in the shear layer produced periodic optical aberrations. Extensive measurement and analysis of these convecting aberrations yielded the underlying structure required to produce the conjugate wavefront correction patterns required for a range of laser propagation angles through the shear layer. Ultimately, a feed-forward adaptive-optic system was developed and used to demonstrate the highest-bandwidth correction of aero-optic aberrations ever performed; the effective bandwidth of the demonstrated adaptive-optic correction was at least two orders of magnitude greater than the capabilities of existing conventional adaptive-optic systems.},

	abstract = {The aero-optical distortions caused by compressible flows have been used by researchers for flow diagnostics and accepted by designers of airborne optical systems as a performance penalty. In order to estimate these distortions, an understanding of the optical distortion mechanism is required. This article examines the mechanisms which produce a variable-density field (and accompanying index-of-refraction field) in a nearly incompressible shear-layer flow. The two-dimensional-shear-layer velocity field was approximated using a discrete vortex model. From this known velocity field, the pressure and density fields were determined by iteratively solving the unsteady Euler equations. The resulting index-of-refraction field produced simulated schlieren images which closely resemble experimental schlierens. Optical wavefronts computed from the simulation reasonably match the behaviour of large-scale aberrations measured in a transonic wind tunnel. Small-scale distortions in the experimental data may have been caused by boundary layers on the splitter plate and tunnel walls or by three-dimensional effects that were not simulated.},

    abstract = {Description This volume is devoted to a systematic examination of the scientific and practical problems that can arise in adapting the new technology of laser beam transmission within the atmosphere to such uses as laser radar, laser beam communications, laser weaponry, and the developing fields of meteorological probing and laser energy transmission, among others. The articles in this book were prepared by specialists in universities, industry, and government laboratories, both military and civilian, and represent an up-to-date survey of the field. The physical problems encountered in such seemingly straightforward applications of laser beam transmission have turned out to be unusually complex. A high intensity radiation beam traversing the atmosphere causes heat-up and breakdown of the air, changing its optical properties along the path, so that the process becomes a nonsteady interactive one. Should the path of the beam include atmospheric turbulence, the resulting nonsteady degradation obviously would affect its reception adversely. An airborne laser system unavoidably requires the beam to traverse a boundary layer or a wake, with complex consequences. These and other effects are examined theoretically and experimentally in this volume. In each case, whereas the phenomenon of beam degradation constitutes a difficulty for the engineer, it presents the scientist with a novel experimental opportunity for meteorlogical or physical research and thus becomes a fruitful nuisance!},

It then reviews how the development of high-speed wavefront sensors over the past 10 years has impacted the fluid-dynamics and optics fields. In particular, the fluid-dynamic mechanisms creating optical distortions are now better understood, and successful aero-optic scaling laws have been developed.

This article reviews the early and present periods of research in aero-optics. Both periods generated impressive amounts of research activity; however, the types and amount of data differ greatly in accuracy, quality, and type owing to the development of new types of instrumentation available to collect and analyze the aberrated wave fronts of otherwise collimated laser beams projected through turbulent compressible flow fields of the type that form over beam directors. This review traces the activities and developments associated with both periods but particularly focuses on the development of modern high-bandwidth wave-front sensors used in the present research period. We describe how these modern wave-front data are collected and analyzed and the fluid mechanic information that can be gleaned from them; the use of these data in the fundamental study of turbulence is emphasized. }

    abstract = {The Mar\'{e}chal approximation for the Strehl ratio versus rms wavefront distortion is widely used in atmospheric scaling law codes, but a complete derivation is absent in the open literature. I present an updated derivation of the first term in Mar\'{e}chal, then a complete derivation. The Strehl ratio is proportional to the square of the Fourier transform of the probability density function of the random phase noise. For Gaussian noise, the traditional Mar\'{e}chal formulation is the result. The more general formulation suggests a method for characterization of random phase aberrations.},

	title={Guidelines for adaptive-optic correction based on aperture filtration},
	abstract={  Aperture filtration refers to the effects of viewing optical wavefront distortions of infinite extent through a finite aperture. If the length-scale of the aberration is larger than this aperture, then the portion of the aberration visible in the aperture at any moment in time will not reach the full magnitude of the aberration seen in its entirety. The aperture acts as a spatial filter, mitigating the effects of large-scale wavefront distortions while having little effect on smaller-scale aberrations, with the dividing line between large-scale and small-scale being the size of the aperture itself. This dissertation presents and charts the development of a set of analytic formulas for judging and predicting the effectiveness of adaptive-optic corrective systems applied over finite apertures. This includes some simplified formulas and benchmarks as guides for the minimum requirements a system will need to meet to be effective, and the maximum degree of effectiveness such systems can reasonably achieve.},

	abstract={The problem of wave-front estimation from wave-front slope measurements has been examined from a least-squares curve fitting model point of view. It is shown that the slope measurement sampling geometry influences the model selection for the phase estimation. Successive over-relaxation (SOR) is employed to numerically solve the exact zonal phase estimation problem. A new zonal phase gradient model is introduced and its error propagator, which relates the mean-square wave-front error to the noisy slope measurements, has been compared with two previously used models. A technique for the rapid extraction of phase aperture functions is presented. Error propagation properties for modal estimation are evaluated and compared with zonal estimation results.},
