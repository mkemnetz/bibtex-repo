  abstract = {Plane turbulent mixing between two streams of different gases (especially nitrogen and helium) was studied in a novel apparatus. Spark shadow pictures showed that, for all ratios of densities in the two streams, the mixing layer is dominated by large coherent structures. High-speed movies showed that these convect at nearly constant speed, and increase their size and spacing discontinuously by amalgamation with neighbouring ones. The pictures and measurements of density fluctuations suggest that turbulent mixing and entrainment is a process of entanglement on the scale of the large structures; some statistical properties of the latter are used to obtain an estimate of entrainment rates. Large changes of the density ratio across the mixing layer were found to have a relatively small effect on the spreading angle; it is concluded that the strong effects, which are observed when one stream is supersonic, are due to compressibility effects, not density effects, as has been generally supposed.},

  title    = {Feed-forward adaptive-optic correction of a weakly-compressible high-subsonic shear layer},
  year     = {2009},
  abstract = {Development of airborne laser systems began in the 1970s with the Airborne Laser Laboratory, a KC135 aircraft with a CO2 laser projected from a beam director mounted atop the aircraft as a hemispherical turret encased in a fairing. It was known that the turbulent air flowing around the turret and separating over the aft portions of the turret would aberrate the laser beam's wavefront (the aero-optic problem); however, the CO2 wavelength, 10.6 μm, was long enough that the aberrating turbulent flow decreased the system's performance by only about 5\%. With newer airborne laser systems using wavelengths nearer 1 μm, this same turbulent flow now reduces system performance by more than 95\%. It has long been known that if a conjugate waveform is used to pre-distort the outgoing laser's wavefront, the turbulence will actually correct the beam, restoring most of the system's performance. The problem with performing this compensation is that the system for performing this function, the so-called adaptive-optic system, is bandwidth limited in its conventional architecture, by orders of magnitude lower than that required to correct for the aero-optic effects. The research described in this dissertation explored changing the adaptive-optic paradigm from feedback to feed-forward by adding flow control to make the aberration environment predictable rather than unpredictable. This research demonstrated that the turbulent high-speed separated shear layer could be robustly forced into a regularized form. It was also shown that these regularized velocity patterns in the shear layer produced periodic optical aberrations. Extensive measurement and analysis of these convecting aberrations yielded the underlying structure required to produce the conjugate wavefront correction patterns required for a range of laser propagation angles through the shear layer. Ultimately, a feed-forward adaptive-optic system was developed and used to demonstrate the highest-bandwidth correction of aero-optic aberrations ever performed; the effective bandwidth of the demonstrated adaptive-optic correction was at least two orders of magnitude greater than the capabilities of existing conventional adaptive-optic systems.},

	abstract = {The aero-optical distortions caused by compressible flows have been used by researchers for flow diagnostics and accepted by designers of airborne optical systems as a performance penalty. In order to estimate these distortions, an understanding of the optical distortion mechanism is required. This article examines the mechanisms which produce a variable-density field (and accompanying index-of-refraction field) in a nearly incompressible shear-layer flow. The two-dimensional-shear-layer velocity field was approximated using a discrete vortex model. From this known velocity field, the pressure and density fields were determined by iteratively solving the unsteady Euler equations. The resulting index-of-refraction field produced simulated schlieren images which closely resemble experimental schlierens. Optical wavefronts computed from the simulation reasonably match the behaviour of large-scale aberrations measured in a transonic wind tunnel. Small-scale distortions in the experimental data may have been caused by boundary layers on the splitter plate and tunnel walls or by three-dimensional effects that were not simulated.},

    abstract = {Description This volume is devoted to a systematic examination of the scientific and practical problems that can arise in adapting the new technology of laser beam transmission within the atmosphere to such uses as laser radar, laser beam communications, laser weaponry, and the developing fields of meteorological probing and laser energy transmission, among others. The articles in this book were prepared by specialists in universities, industry, and government laboratories, both military and civilian, and represent an up-to-date survey of the field. The physical problems encountered in such seemingly straightforward applications of laser beam transmission have turned out to be unusually complex. A high intensity radiation beam traversing the atmosphere causes heat-up and breakdown of the air, changing its optical properties along the path, so that the process becomes a nonsteady interactive one. Should the path of the beam include atmospheric turbulence, the resulting nonsteady degradation obviously would affect its reception adversely. An airborne laser system unavoidably requires the beam to traverse a boundary layer or a wake, with complex consequences. These and other effects are examined theoretically and experimentally in this volume. In each case, whereas the phenomenon of beam degradation constitutes a difficulty for the engineer, it presents the scientist with a novel experimental opportunity for meteorlogical or physical research and thus becomes a fruitful nuisance!},

It is found that a large-scale motion in the log region becomes increasingly comparable in energy to the near-wall cycle as the Reynolds number increases. Through decomposition of fluctuating velocity signals, it is shown that this large-scale motion has a distinct modulating influence on the small-scale energy (akin to amplitude modulation). Reassessment of DNS data, in light of these results, shows similar trends, with the rate and intensity of production due to the near-wall cycle subject to a modulating influence from the largest-scale motions.},

The study of these aberrations (when the aberrating flowfield is of relatively short propagation length in the near field of the optical system) is referred to as aero-optics. This article begins with a brief discussion of the traditional approach to quantifying aero-optic interactions. It then reviews how the development of high-speed wavefront sensors over the past 10 years has impacted the fluid-dynamics and optics fields. In particular, the fluid-dynamic mechanisms creating optical distortions are now better understood, and successful aero-optic scaling laws have been developed.

This article reviews the early and present periods of research in aero-optics. Both periods generated impressive amounts of research activity; however, the types and amount of data differ greatly in accuracy, quality, and type owing to the development of new types of instrumentation available to collect and analyze the aberrated wave fronts of otherwise collimated laser beams projected through turbulent compressible flow fields of the type that form over beam directors. This review traces the activities and developments associated with both periods but particularly focuses on the development of modern high-bandwidth wave-front sensors used in the present research period. We describe how these modern wave-front data are collected and analyzed and the fluid mechanic information that can be gleaned from them; the use of these data in the fundamental study of turbulence is emphasized. }

abstract = {The growth rate and turbulent structure of the compressible, plane shear layer are investigated experimentally in a novel facility. In this facility, it is possible to flow similar or dissimilar gases of different densities and to select different Mach numbers for each stream. Ten combinations of gases and Mach numbers are studied in which the free-stream Mach numbers range from 0.2 to 4. Schlieren photography of 20-ns exposure time reveals very low spreading rates and large-scale structures. The growth of the turbulent region is defined by means of Pitot-pressure profiles measured at several streamwise locations. A compressibility-effect parameter is defined that correlates and unifies the experimental results. It is the Mach number in a coordinate system convecting with the velocity of the dominant waves and structures of the shear layer, called here the convective Mach number. It happens to have nearly the same value for each stream. In the current experiments, it ranges from 0 to 1.9. The correlations of the growth rate with convective Mach number fall approximately onto one curve when the growth rate is normalized by its incompressible value at the same velocity and density ratios. The normalized growth rate, which is unity for incompressible flow, decreases rapidly with increasing convective Mach number, reaching an asymptotic vaue of about 0.2 for supersonic convective Mach numbers.},

	title={Guidelines for adaptive-optic correction based on aperture filtration},
	abstract={  Aperture filtration refers to the effects of viewing optical wavefront distortions of infinite extent through a finite aperture. If the length-scale of the aberration is larger than this aperture, then the portion of the aberration visible in the aperture at any moment in time will not reach the full magnitude of the aberration seen in its entirety. The aperture acts as a spatial filter, mitigating the effects of large-scale wavefront distortions while having little effect on smaller-scale aberrations, with the dividing line between large-scale and small-scale being the size of the aperture itself. This dissertation presents and charts the development of a set of analytic formulas for judging and predicting the effectiveness of adaptive-optic corrective systems applied over finite apertures. This includes some simplified formulas and benchmarks as guides for the minimum requirements a system will need to meet to be effective, and the maximum degree of effectiveness such systems can reasonably achieve.},

Successive over-relaxation (SOR) is employed to numerically solve the exact zonal phase estimation problem. A new zonal phase gradient model is introduced and its error propagator, which relates the mean-square wave-front error to the noisy slope measurements, has been compared with two previously used models. A technique for the rapid extraction of phase aperture functions is presented. Error propagation properties for modal estimation are evaluated and compared with zonal estimation results.},

  abstract  = {The spatial structure of smooth- and rough-wall boundary layers is examined spectrally at approximately matched friction Reynolds number ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D6FF}^{+}\approx 12\,000$ ). For each wall condition, temporal and true spatial descriptions of the same flow are available from hot-wire anemometry and high-spatial-range particle image velocimetry, respectively. The results show that over the resolved flow domain, which is limited to a streamwise length of twice the boundary layer thickness, true spatial spectra of smooth-wall streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations agree, to within experimental uncertainty, with those obtained from time series using Taylorâs frozen turbulence hypothesis ( Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 164, 1938, pp. 476â490). The same applies for the streamwise velocity spectra on rough walls. For the wall-normal velocity spectra, however, clear differences are observed between the true spatial and temporally convected spectra. For the rough-wall spectra, a correction is derived to enable accurate prediction of wall-normal velocity length scales from measurements of their time scales, and the implications of this correction are considered. Potential violations to Taylorâs hypothesis in flows above perturbed walls may help to explain conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the effect of near-wall modifications on outer-region flow. In this regard, all true spatial and corrected spectra presented here indicate structural similarity in the outer region of smooth- and rough-wall flows, providing evidence for Townsendâs wall-similarity hypothesis ( The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow , vol. 1, 1956).},

	abstract = {The effect of the thin turbulent layers, including boundary layers and shear layers, on light propagation is examined from a theoretical point of view. In particular, a mathematical model is developed to describe the interaction between the aerodynamic or, more precisely, the density fluctuations and the electromagnetic field. It is assumed that the turbulence induces a normally distributed phase aberration which is a homogenous random function in the plane of the aperture. The optical degradation is described in terms of the optical transfer function and the Strehl ratio which are random. Expressions for the first and second moments of these two parameters are developed from the definitions. Asymptotic (large aperture) approximations to these expressions are derived and discussed. Finally, the exact approximate results are compared for several typical values of the ratios of aperture diameter to scale of density fluctuations and rms phase aberration to wave length respectively.},

	abstract = {Strong turbulence causes phase discontinuities known as branch points in an optical field. These discontinuities complicate the phase unwrapping necessary to apply phase corrections onto a deformable mirror in an adaptive optics (AO) system. This paper proposes a non-optimal but effective and implementable phase unwrapping method for optical fields containing branch points. This method first applies a least-squares (LS) unwrapper to the field which isolates and unwraps the LS component of the field. Four modulo-2pi-equivalent non-LS components are created by subtracting the LS component from the original field and then restricting the result to differing ranges. 2pi phase jumps known as branch cuts are isolated to the non-LS components and the different non-LS realizations have different branch cut placements. The best placement of branch cuts is determined by finding the non-LS realization with the lowest normalized cut length and adding it to the LS component. The result is an unwrapped field which is modulo-2pi -equivalent to the original field while minimizing the effect of phase cuts on system performance. This variable-range 'phi LS +phi non phi LS' unwrapper, is found to outperform other unwrappers designed to work in the presence of branch points at a reasonable computational burden. The effect of improved unwrapping is demonstrated by comparing the performance of a system using a fixed-range phi 'LS + phi non--LS' realization unwrapper against the variable-range 'phi LS +phi non--LS' unwrapper in a closed-loop simulation. For the 0.5 log-amplitude variance turbulence tested, the system Strehl performance is improved by as much as 41.6 percent at points where fixed-range 'phi LS + phi non phi LS' unwrappers result in particularly poor branch cut placement. This significant improvement in previously poorly performing regions is particularly important for systems such as laser communications which require minimum Strehl ratios to operate successfully.},

	abstract = {Abstract Compressible large-eddy simulations are carried out to study the aero-optical distortions caused by Mach 0.5 flat-plate turbulent boundary layers at Reynolds numbers of ${\mathit{Re}}_{\theta } = 875$ , 1770 and 3550, based on momentum thickness. The fluctuations of refractive index are calculated from the density field, and wavefront distortions of an optical beam traversing the boundary layer are computed based on geometric optics. The effects of aperture size, small-scale turbulence, different flow regions and beam elevation angle are examined and the underlying flow physics is analysed. It is found that the level of optical distortion decreases with increasing Reynolds number within the Reynolds-number range considered. The contributions from the viscous sublayer and buffer layer are small, while the wake region plays a dominant role, followed by the logarithmic layer. By low-pass filtering the fluctuating density field, it is shown that small-scale turbulence is optically inactive. Consistent with previous experimental findings, the distortion magnitude is dependent on the propagation direction due to anisotropy of the boundary-layer vortical structures. Density correlations and length scales are analysed to understand the elevation-angle dependence and its relation to turbulence structures. The applicability of Suttonâs linking equation to boundary-layer flows is examined, and excellent agreement between linking equation predictions and directly integrated distortions is obtained when the density length scale is appropriately defined.},

	abstract = {<p>Wavefront measurements from wind tunnel or flight testing of an optical system are affected by jitter sources due to the measurement platform, system vibrations, or aero-mechanical buffeting. Depending on the nature of the testing, the wavefront jitter will be a composite of several effects, one of which is the aero-optical jitter; i.e., the wavefront tilt due to random air density fluctuations. To isolate the aero-optical jitter component from recent testing, we have developed an estimation technique that uses only higher-order wavefront measurements to determine the jitter. By analogy with work done previously with free-stream turbulence, we have developed a minimum mean-square error estimator using higher-order wavefront modes to compute the current-frame tilt components through a linear operation. The estimator is determined from computational fluid dynamics evaluation of aero-optical disturbances, but does not depend on the strength of such disturbances. Applying this technique to turret flight test data, we found aero-optical jitter to be 7.7±0.8  μrad and to scale with (ρ/ρSL)M2 (∼1  μrad in the actual test cases examined). The half-power point of the aero-optical jitter variance was found to be ∼2u∞/Dt and to roll off in temporal frequency with a power law between f−11/3 and f−10/3.</p>},
