  title={Feed-forward adaptive-optic correction of a weakly-compressible high-subsonic shear layer},
  journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
  pages={311},
  abstract={Development of airborne laser systems began in the 1970s with the Airborne Laser Laboratory, a KC135 aircraft with a CO2 laser projected from a beam director mounted atop the aircraft as a hemispherical turret encased in a fairing. It was known that the turbulent air flowing around the turret and separating over the aft portions of the turret would aberrate the laser beam's wavefront (the aero-optic problem); however, the CO2 wavelength, 10.6 μm, was long enough that the aberrating turbulent flow decreased the system's performance by only about 5\%. With newer airborne laser systems using wavelengths nearer 1 μm, this same turbulent flow now reduces system performance by more than 95\%. It has long been known that if a conjugate waveform is used to pre-distort the outgoing laser's wavefront, the turbulence will actually correct the beam, restoring most of the system's performance. The problem with performing this compensation is that the system for performing this function, the so-called adaptive-optic system, is bandwidth limited in its conventional architecture, by orders of magnitude lower than that required to correct for the aero-optic effects. The research described in this dissertation explored changing the adaptive-optic paradigm from feedback to feed-forward by adding flow control to make the aberration environment predictable rather than unpredictable. This research demonstrated that the turbulent high-speed separated shear layer could be robustly forced into a regularized form. It was also shown that these regularized velocity patterns in the shear layer produced periodic optical aberrations. Extensive measurement and analysis of these convecting aberrations yielded the underlying structure required to produce the conjugate wavefront correction patterns required for a range of laser propagation angles through the shear layer. Ultimately, a feed-forward adaptive-optic system was developed and used to demonstrate the highest-bandwidth correction of aero-optic aberrations ever performed; the effective bandwidth of the demonstrated adaptive-optic correction was at least two orders of magnitude greater than the capabilities of existing conventional adaptive-optic systems.},

	abstract={The passage of a planar-wavefront optical beam through a turbulent, index-of-refraction-variant flowfield imprints dynamically changing aberrations on the wavefront; these aberrations have detrimental effects on the performance of optical systems making use of the beam. The study of these aberrations (when the aberrating flowfield is of relatively short propagation length in the near field of the optical system) is referred to as aero-optics. This article begins with a brief discussion of the traditional approach to quantifying aero-optic interactions. It then reviews how the development of high-speed wavefront sensors over the past 10 years has impacted the fluid-dynamics and optics fields. In particular, the fluid-dynamic mechanisms creating optical distortions are now better understood, and successful aero-optic scaling laws have been developed. The article concludes with a description of future trends in aero-optical research.},

I present an updated derivation of the first term in Mar\'{e}chal, then a complete derivation. The Strehl ratio is proportional to the square of the Fourier transform of the probability density function of the random phase noise. For Gaussian noise, the traditional Mar\'{e}chal formulation is the result. The more general formulation suggests a method for characterization of random phase aberrations.},

	title={Guidelines for adaptive-optic correction based on aperture filtration},
	abstract={  Aperture filtration refers to the effects of viewing optical wavefront distortions of infinite extent through a finite aperture. If the length-scale of the aberration is larger than this aperture, then the portion of the aberration visible in the aperture at any moment in time will not reach the full magnitude of the aberration seen in its entirety. The aperture acts as a spatial filter, mitigating the effects of large-scale wavefront distortions while having little effect on smaller-scale aberrations, with the dividing line between large-scale and small-scale being the size of the aperture itself. This dissertation presents and charts the development of a set of analytic formulas for judging and predicting the effectiveness of adaptive-optic corrective systems applied over finite apertures. This includes some simplified formulas and benchmarks as guides for the minimum requirements a system will need to meet to be effective, and the maximum degree of effectiveness such systems can reasonably achieve.},

Successive over-relaxation (SOR) is employed to numerically solve the exact zonal phase estimation problem. A new zonal phase gradient model is introduced and its error propagator, which relates the mean-square wave-front error to the noisy slope measurements, has been compared with two previously used models. A technique for the rapid extraction of phase aperture functions is presented. Error propagation properties for modal estimation are evaluated and compared with zonal estimation results.},
